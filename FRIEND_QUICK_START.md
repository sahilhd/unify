# UniLLM Quick Start for Friends! 🚀

This is a super easy way to get started with UniLLM and build cool AI applications using multiple models with just one API key!

## What is UniLLM?

UniLLM is a unified API that lets you use different AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) with a single API key. No more managing multiple API keys!

## Quick Setup (3 steps!)

### 1. Install the library
```bash
pip install unifyllm-sdk
```

### 2. Get your API key
1. Go to your UniLLM dashboard (ask your friend for the URL!)
2. Register a new account
3. Copy your API key from the dashboard

### 3. Run the example
1. Download `friend_quick_start.py`
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
3. Replace the backend URL with your friend's deployed backend
4. Run: `python friend_quick_start.py`

## What the example shows:

🤖 **Basic Chat** - Simple conversations with GPT-3.5 and Claude
✍️ **Creative Writing** - Get different writing styles from different models
💻 **Code Assistant** - Code solutions and explanations
🗣️ **Multi-Model Chat** - Compare perspectives from different AIs
🌍 **Language Learning** - Grammar help and cultural context
💡 **Brainstorming** - Creative and practical ideas

## Cool things you can build:

- **AI Writing Assistant** - Switch between creative and analytical writing
- **Code Helper** - Get code from GPT-3.5, explanations from Claude
- **Language Tutor** - Grammar help and cultural insights
- **Idea Generator** - Creative brainstorming with different AI personalities
- **Multi-Perspective Chat** - Get different viewpoints on any topic

## Pro Tips:

- **GPT-3.5**: Great for code and quick responses
- **GPT-4**: Best for creative and complex tasks  
- **Claude**: Excellent for reasoning and detailed explanations
- **Mix and match** models for different perspectives!

## Need help?

If something doesn't work:
1. Check that you replaced the API key correctly
2. Make sure the backend URL is right
3. Ensure you have credits in your account
4. Ask your friend who set this up! 😄
